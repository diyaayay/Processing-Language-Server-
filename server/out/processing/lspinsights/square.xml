<description><![CDATA[
Draws a square to the screen. A square is a four-sided shape with every angle at ninety degrees and each side is the same length. By default, the first two parameters set the location of the upper-left corner, the third sets the width and height. The way these parameters are interpreted, however, may be changed with the <b>rectMode()</b> function.<br />
