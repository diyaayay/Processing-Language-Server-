<description><![CDATA[
Sets the current font that will be drawn with the <b>text()</b> function. Fonts must be created for Processing with <b>createFont()</b> or loaded with <b>loadFont()</b> before they can be used. The font set through <b>textFont()</b> will be used in all subsequent calls to the <b>text()</b> function. If no <b>size</b> parameter is specified, the font size defaults to the original size (the size in which it was created with the "Create Font..." tool) overriding any previous calls to <b>textFont()</b> or <b>textSize()</b>.<br />
<br /> When fonts are rendered as an image texture (as is the case with the P2D and P3D renderers as well as with <b>loadFont()</b> and vlw files), you should create fonts at the sizes that will be used most commonly. Using <b>textFont()</b> without the size parameter will result in the cleanest type.<br />
